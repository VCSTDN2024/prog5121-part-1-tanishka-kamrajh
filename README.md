This assignment is a chat app demo.

Its purpose is to allow people to communicate digitally.
This assignment asked that the chat app have certain parameters for the users' details. This includes their username, password, and phone number.
These aspects are prompted as the project runs and respond appropriately to guide the user through the registration and login processes.

In part one, the main point is to build the base of this chat app and allow any user to register, login, and be able to use the chat app.
However, this chat app will grow and become extremely useful as it will aid in students learning how the frontend and backend work in a project. 
It will improve their overall programming skills and enable them to produce clean and functional code as they complete the POE chat app project.  

At the beginning of this project, students are asked to create a main, user, and login class.
These classes all perform certain roles Main class acts as the presentation point, the User class holds the usersâ€™ face value details, and the Login class holds both the business and data side of this project it acting as the central point.
That is why the Login class will hold most of the code, and when the Main class is run, responses to the users' data will come from the Login class.

Part 2 builds on Part 1 and allows users to send messages. The project calls for the creation of a message class to do this.
A multitude of functional aspects are requested, which is challenging to initially grasp, but ultimately, when implemented, creates a beautiful application. 
By utilizing JOptionPanes, it establishes a user-friendly system that resembles a real-life application.
More than just a console system, these aspects compel students to explore programming further and to express these features through efficient and practical code.

Throughout Part 2, more specific application functions are added, such as autogenerated 10-digit identification codes, and recipient cell phone numbers that 
contains the South African code, and many more functions. These all help create that real application environment.
One task that is not asked for in Part 1 is that the unit tests have to be automated in order to work even once the code is altered.
