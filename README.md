This assignment is a chat app demo.

Its purpose is to allow people to communicate digitally.
This assignment asked that the chat app have certain parameters for the users' details. This includes their username, password, and phone number.
These aspects are prompted as the project runs and respond appropriately to guide the user through the registration and login processes.

In part one, the main point is to build the base of this chat app and allow any user to register, login, and be able to use the chat app.
However, this chat app will grow and become extremely useful as it will aid in students learning how the frontend and backend work in a project. 
It will improve their overall programming skills and enable them to produce clean and functional code as they complete the POE chat app project.  

At the beginning of this project, students are asked to create a main, user, and login class.
These classes all perform certain roles Main class acts as the presentation point, the User class holds the usersâ€™ face value details, and the Login class holds both the business and data side of this project it acting as the central point.
That is why the Login class will hold most of the code, and when the Main class is run, responses to the users' data will come from the Login class.
